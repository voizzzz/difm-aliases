difm-aliases (Tested on Ubuntu)
============
To use it, copy the .bash_aliases file into your home directory or if you already have one, copy its contents to yours. Every alias is in this form:

alias difm-chiptunes='mplayer http://pub7.di.fm/di_chiptunes'

So if you type difm-chiptunes on terminal, it starts playing the station. You can write difm and press tab to watch all possible genres.

You need to have mplayer installed (sudo apt-get install mplayer) and restart terminal after you copied the aliases.

You can modify the aliases however it suits you.
